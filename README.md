# Endless Rooftops

A tiny, GitHub Pages–ready endless platformer.

**Controls**
- **Space**: Hold to charge jump (longer hold = higher jump)
- **← / →**: Guide your jump in mid‑air (hold to drift farther)
- **R**: Restart after death

**Rules**
- Hop across rooftops. If you fall into the plants, you die.
- Swords and snakes spawn randomly on rooftops. Touching either = death.
- The map generates infinitely to the right with varied gaps, heights, and hazards.

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy on GitHub
1. Create a new repo and upload all files in this folder (keep the `assets/` directory as-is).
2. In GitHub settings → **Pages**, set the branch to **main** and the root to **/ (root)**.
3. Wait for Pages to build; your game will be live at the Pages URL.
